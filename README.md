In this  coursera's "Python project for Data Science", I analysed Tesla's shares from https://finance.yahoo.com/, in order to see broader picture of their stock prices.
Then, I used coursera's page with the data, regarding Tesla's revenue, in order to get additional insights, whether invest in Tesla or not. 
Although the task had more of an analytical nature, I had to apply solid data engineering skills, as I needed to load datasets, which would work outside of Coursera's orecoded environment.
